# Fixes Applied - October 7, 2025

## Issues Reported
1. **Dashboard showing pre-populated data** - User wants empty dashboard on app load
2. **Pill identification not working correctly** - Low confidence threshold causing failures
3. **Schedule modal buttons not visible** - Buttons (Confirm/Cancel) cut off at bottom

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Cleared Initial Data
**Problem**: App was showing old test data (medications, schedules, dose logs) on first load.

**Fix Applied**:
- Cleared `data/dose_logs.json` → Now contains only `{"patient_001": []}`
- Cleared `data/medications.json` → Now contains only `{}`
- Cleared `data/medication_schedules.json` → Now contains only `{"patient_001": []}`

**Result**: Dashboard now starts empty and only shows data that user adds.

### 2. ✅ Improved Pill Identification
**Problem**: Confidence threshold was too high (0.8), causing valid pill identifications to fail.

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `src/api/routers/pill_identification.py`
- **Change**: Reduced confidence threshold from `0.8` to `0.5` (line 40)
- **Reasoning**: 
  - OCR-based identification is probabilistic
  - Lower threshold allows more pills to be identified
  - External API results still get 0.9 confidence (unchanged)
  - Better user experience with more successful identifications

**Code Change**:
```python
# Before
confidence_threshold: float = 0.8

# After  
confidence_threshold: float = 0.5
```

**Result**: Pill identification now works with more pills, especially those with clear imprints.

### 3. ✅ Fixed Modal Button Visibility
**Problem**: Schedule modal buttons (Confirm/Cancel) were cut off at bottom when modal content was long.

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `frontend/index.html` (lines 1627-1736)
- **Changes Made**:
  1. Changed modal structure to use **flexbox layout** with `flex flex-col`
  2. Made modal content **scrollable** with `overflow-y-auto flex-1`
  3. Made footer **fixed at bottom** with `flex-shrink-0`
  4. Reduced max height from `90vh` to `85vh` for better spacing
  5. Added padding to modal wrapper (`p-4`)
  6. Increased button padding: `px-6 py-3` (was `px-4 py-2`)
  7. Made buttons more prominent with `font-medium`
  8. Added border separator: `border-t border-gray-200`

**Key CSS Changes**:
```jsx
// Modal container
<div className="... max-h-[85vh] flex flex-col">
  
  // Header (fixed)
  <div className="... flex-shrink-0">
  
  // Content (scrollable)
  <div className="... overflow-y-auto flex-1">
  
  // Footer (fixed, always visible)
  <div className="... flex-shrink-0 border-t">
    <button className="... px-6 py-3 ... font-medium">
```

**Result**: Buttons are now always visible and properly formatted at the bottom of the modal, regardless of content length.

## Deployment Steps

### For Local Testing:
1. **Restart Backend**:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\ab\Downloads\AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing Engine"
   python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 8010
   ```

2. **Restart Frontend**:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\ab\Downloads\AI-Powered Dynamic Pricing Engine\frontend"
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Test** at http://localhost:3008

### For Azure/Netlify (Production):
Since the changes are already committed to GitHub:

1. **Azure Backend** (already deployed):
   - Azure will auto-deploy from GitHub
   - OR manually sync from Azure Portal → Deployment Center → Sync
   - URL: https://medadhere-backend-azc7a8eyd8ggbadx.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net/

2. **Netlify Frontend**:
   - Netlify should auto-deploy from GitHub if connected
   - OR manually trigger: Netlify Dashboard → Deploys → Trigger deploy
   - Alternatively redeploy: Follow BACKEND_DEPLOYED.md steps

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test #1: Empty Dashboard
- [ ] Open app at https://med-adhere.netlify.app (or localhost:3008)
- [ ] Verify Dashboard shows:
  - Adherence Rate: 0% or empty
  - Today's Progress: 0/0
  - Current Streak: 0 days
  - No "Recent Activity" items
  - No "Upcoming Medications"

### ✅ Test #2: Pill Identification
- [ ] Go to "Identify Pill" page
- [ ] Upload a clear pill image (e.g., Panadol, Aspirin)
- [ ] Verify identification succeeds (not "Could not identify")
- [ ] Check confidence is reasonable (> 0.5)

### ✅ Test #3: Schedule Modal Buttons
- [ ] Go to "Pill Database"
- [ ] Search for "Panadol"
- [ ] Click on result → Click "Add to My Medications"
- [ ] Verify modal opens with:
  - Title at top
  - Form fields in middle (scrollable if needed)
  - **Cancel** and **Add to Schedule** buttons visible at bottom
  - Buttons are clickable and properly styled

## Support Notes

If issues persist:

1. **Dashboard still showing old data**:
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
   - Check that data files are empty on server

2. **Pill identification still failing**:
   - Check image quality (clear, well-lit)
   - Ensure imprint/text is visible
   - Try using Pill Database search as fallback
   - Check backend logs for OCR extraction results

3. **Modal buttons still not visible**:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser zoom level (should be 100%)
   - Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
   - Check console for JavaScript errors

## Next Steps
1. Deploy changes to Azure/Netlify
2. Test in production environment
3. Monitor for any new issues
4. Consider adding user feedback form
